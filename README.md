Turn the fader board from a Yamaha 01v mixer into a compact OSC controller

The [Yamaha 01v](https://usa.yamaha.com/files/download/other_assets/0/320870/01VE.pdf) was my favorite digital mixer of the 90s.
However I recently upgraded, to the [X-Air Xr-18 by Behringer](https://www.musictribe.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Digital/XR18/p/P0BI8).
The XR-18 is so cheap, does so much, and I chose it based on certain criteria:

1. 24bit for headroom, the 16bit 01v made me work too hard up front
2. Lots of digital in/outs to my PC. I would have been happy with 8/8, but the XR-18 comes with 18/18
3. Physical controls

And it's the last point that makes the XR-18 sad for me, I like having physical faders. So this project is all about using
the motorized faders of my ailing 01v as a Fader Controller for the XR-18 (and everything else)
